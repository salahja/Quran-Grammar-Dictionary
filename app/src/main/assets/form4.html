			<td class="c3">This pattern is similar to form II in
			that it makes intransitive verbs transitive, and transitive verbs
			doubly so. This form has the meaning of:
			<ol>
				<li>He made himself do or perform an action.</li>
				<li>A reflexive causative, i.e. he made himself do something transformative to a place or a state.</li>
			</ol>
			In the first example on the right, he made himself "destroy the crops".
			<p>
			In the second example, the verb is causative, so that he made himself
			"want to harm".
			<p>
			In the third example, he was not of the losers before this action of killing,
			but now was transformed into that state.
