			<td class="c3">Form 6 is the reflection of how the object underwent
			the action of form 3
			(<span class="r1">F</span>-aa-<span class="r2">3</span>-a-<span class="r3">L</span>-a).
			Notice that as in form 5, this
			is obtained by adding ta- before the verb. Since form 3 implies an
			action done on someone, form 6 implies reciprocity as in the English
			sentence "they looked at each other".
			<p>The subject cannot be singular in this function of the form.
			For example,
			t-a-<span class="r1">K</span>-aa-<span class="r2">T</span>-a-<span class="r3">B</span>-a
			itself would mean "they corresponded
			with each other" (they wrote to each other). Here they support one
			another in this particular action. This usually reflects the meaning
			of:
			<ol>
				<li>Pure mutuality, e.g.
				t-a-<span class="r1">B</span>-aa-<span class="r2">D</span>-a-<span class="r3">L</span>-a
				"he exchanged" takes
				one object, or
				t-a-<span class="r1">3</span>-aa-<span class="r2">W</span>-a-<span class="r3">N</span>-a
				"he became assisting". More than one
				party needs to be involved in this action</li>
				<li>Conative - he made himself be the doer.</li>
				<li>Pretension – he made himself do something, e.g. "He made himself appear to forget".</li>
			</ol>
