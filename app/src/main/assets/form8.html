			"he wrote", where the object of form 1 becomes its own object. This form reflects two meanings:
			<ol>
				<li>Either conative or causative (to make oneself do).</li>
				<li>Reciprocal.</li>
			</ol>
			In the conative example on the right, the verb is
			i-<span class="r1">3</span>-t-a-<span class="r2">R</span>-a-<span class="r3">DH</span>-a
			"to excuse oneself". Here in the second person, the meaning becomes "do not excuse yourselves".
			<p>
			In the causative example, they made themselves take a conscious effortful action.
