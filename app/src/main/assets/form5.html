			t-a-<span class="r1">F</span>-<span class="r2">33</span>-a-<span class="r3">L</span>-a
			form 5 verb is from the point of view of the object of the verb. This
			usually reflects the reflexive or effective meaning, e.g. "he made

			<p>In the first example on the right,
			<span class="r1">DH</span>-a-<span class="r2">KK</span>-a-<span class="r3">R</span>-a
			"to remind"
			is form II, and now in form V it is from the point of view of the
			object, i.e. "he received the reminder".
			<p>In the second example, the verb here is
			t-a-<span class="r1">GH</span>-a-<span class="r2">YY</span>-a-<span class="r3">R</span>-a
			"to undergo change", so these rivers in paradise do not undergo any change of
