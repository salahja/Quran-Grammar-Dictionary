			<td class="c3">This form implies that there is someone or
			something else present and that the action is performed upon
			him/her/it. This forms reflects meaning in two ways:
			<ol>
				<li>Causative ("to be") as an active participle.</li>
				<li>Mutual action (he made him do the same).</li>
			</ol>
			In the causative example on the right, the active participle is
			derived from form I
			<span class="r1">SH</span>-a-<span class="r2">H</span>-i-<span class="r3">D</span>-a
			"to witness" or "to be present",
			which also occurs in the same verse. So here it is almost as if to
			say "he caused himself to witness".
			<p>In the second example, the verb "fight" requires someone to be
			fought with, and so the action is mutual.
