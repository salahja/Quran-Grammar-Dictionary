			<td class="c3">A verb that is already transitive becomes doubly so,
			as it takes a meaning of "make do" or "make become", so the meaning
			could be "to make one learn" i.e. "to teach". This form reflects
			meaning in three ways:
			<ol>
					<li>Intensity of the verb (repetition or the energy in which the action is performed).</li>
					<li>He made himself do (to make himself).</li>
					<li>Causative (to make another do).</li>
			</ol>
			In the intensity example on the right, the form of the verb shows the
			intensity and the repetition of the action, i.e. she closed all the doors
			and bolted them.
