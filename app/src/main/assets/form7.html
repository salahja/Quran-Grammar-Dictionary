			<td class="c3">This form expresses submission to an action or effect.
			In the case of an animate being, this is an involuntary submission. The
			form reflects meaning on two levels:
			<ol>
				<li>Reflexive (to let oneself be put through).</li>
				<li>Angentless passive (non-reciprocal of form I).</li>
			</ol>
			In the second example, the verb is
			i-n-<span class="r1">F</span>-a-<span class="r2">T</span>-a-<span class="r3">R</span>-a
			"to be taken apart". In the Quranic sense, the agent of the action is God, as the skies do not split
			without a cause. But here it serves the heaven's submission to be broken apart.
